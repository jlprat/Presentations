                            Here we can see, how a a card in the players hand is magnified, for example when the player
                            taps/clicks on it. This is a quite common technique to improve user experience.

                            There is no need for transitions as it is a static element.

                            For simplicity, I was working with percentages in the previous examples, but if you want to
                            develop a game, you should think about getting away of the pixel world and create your own
                            coordinates system (for example 0 to 100) this way you can get abstracted from the real screen
                            size. However, you need to calculate some of these values in your JS and then apply inline
                            styles.
                            These are only some easy tips, but there are much more hints and tips you can use.
                            Also the examples are quite easy, but our HTML5 games are done purely with DOM.
                            I recommend you to try them out.
